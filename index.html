          I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were
          current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I
          got every penny’s worth.

          “I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been
          looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an
          amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and
          found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12
          weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since
          completing the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as
          a Software Engineer at a VR startup.”

          “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I
          needed some structure from who can help me learn programming step by
          step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can
          only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and
          staff did not disappoint. They were hands-on and I never had to wait
          long for assistance. The agile team, in particular, was outstanding.
          It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could
          ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an
          example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job
          as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100%
          recommend! ”

          Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves.
